This is just a place for me to store and record my solutions to the exercises here: https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

I'm trying to do one per day to practice my Haskell and functional programming in general. There's some cool stuff out there like ReactJS, RamdaJS, Elixir, Phoenix, Erlang, Scotty (Haskell Sinatra clone), and I'd like to move from DevOps to functional software engineering one day (but not while Kubernetes is fresh and exciting). And until then, function composition and functional thinking in general are a good fit for infrastructure as code practices now practiced in good DevOps teams.

I'll probably never go back to these after solving them, except to try and solve them differently (e.g. without syntactic sugar, or using only higher-order functions) or add things like Quickcheck tests. The solutions are in no way meant to be optimal - this is purely a learning/practice exercise for me. I figure the key is consistent practice/exposure.
