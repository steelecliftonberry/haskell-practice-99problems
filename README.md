Just a place for my solutions to these Haskell exercises: https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

I will possibly revisit some exercises to solve them using a different pattern, optimise performance, or add QuickCheck or HUnit tests. These solutions are not meant to be optimal or represent Haskell best practices.
